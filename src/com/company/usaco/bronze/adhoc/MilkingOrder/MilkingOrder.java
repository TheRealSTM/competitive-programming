/**
 * Problem Description: http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=832
 * Problem Notes:
 * - N cows from 2 <= N <= 100
 * - Order of being milked indicates social status (earlier means more status)
 * - Some cows only like being milked in specific positions (ex: 2nd)
 * - There will always be an order that satisfies the conditions
 * - Determine the earliest position that cow 1 can go
 *
 * Inputs:
 * - N M K where N is the number of cows, M is the number of cows who follow a social hierarchy, and K
 *   is the number fo cows who want to be in a specific position
 * - The next line indicates the social hierarchy
 * - Showing the position that the cow needs to be milked in
