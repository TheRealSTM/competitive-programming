/**
 * Problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/1903/problem/C
 *
 * Task Notes:
 * - He has an array a of size n wants to divide it into non-empty subarrays such that every element is in exactly
 *   one of the subarrays
 * - Cypriot value of such division is equal to sum from i = 1 to k and i * sum_i where k is the subarrays that we divided
 *   the array into and sum is sum_i is the sum of the ith subarray
 * - Task: Find max Cypriot value of any division of the array
 *
 * Input:
 * - t contains a single integer for number of test cases
 * - each test case:
 *   - n : size of the array
 *   - integers in n [a1 ... an]
 *
 * Thoughts:
 * - It is a dynamic programming problem - we cannot
 * - It requires calculating the prefix sum
